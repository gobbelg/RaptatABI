# Specify the parameters used to score performance of two different, xml-based annotation sets using RapTAT 
# based on a series of descriptors of the task.  Precede each parameter descriptor on a new line with either
# a "short" (generally one letter) or "long" option of those listed below preceded by a hyphen.  In some 
# cases, the use of upper and lower case in the descriptors must be carefully followed.  This is generally
# necessary when describing file paths or specifying particular java classes.  Also, some descriptors have to 
# be surrounded by quotes for proper parsing. Quotes can always be added but are almost always unnecessary.
# Finally, some parameters may take multiple descriptors and require a specific character (generally '^' or '~')
# to denote how the descriptors are delimited.  Specification of the requirements for each descriptor in terms
# of use of lower and upper case, quotes, multiple descriptors, and descriptor delimiters is provided below. 
#
# A '#' sign at the beginning of a line indicates a comment.

# Special Command Line Property Options
# (Not generally used within a property file itself) 
#=============================================

# Path to the file to use for parsing the properties File.  The file has the settings of properties to use during RapTAT training.
# This option is included here for example purposes only as this file itself is a properties file.
# Generally, the -p option would be set via the command line in calling the main method the TokenSequenceSolutionTrainer class. 
# 
# Property descriptor requires proper upper and lower case: TRUE
# Property descriptor must be surrounded by quotes: TRUE if spaces in path included after -p option 
#
# EXAMPLE: If the class were within a jar called RapTAT located
# within the directory C:PathToRaptatJar\Raptat.jar, you would use:
# java -classpath C:\PathToRaptatJar\Raptat.jar src.main.gov.va.vha09.grecc.raptat.gg.analysis.scorer.PerformanceScorer -p "D:\PathToPropertiesFile\PerformanceScoreTemplate_180307.prop"



# Show the help for running the TokenSequenceSolutionTrainer class and the available parameter settings
#
# EXAMPLE: If the class is within a jar called RapTAT located within the directory C:\java\Myclasses\Raptat.jar, you would use:
# java -classpath C:\PathToRaptatJar\Raptat.jar src.main.gov.va.vha09.grecc.raptat.gg.analysis.scorer.PerformanceScorer -h

# REQUIRED property options

# Path to directory of text files that were annotated and correspond to the two sets of annotations within the xml directories
#
# Property descriptor requires proper upper and lower case: TRUE
# Property descriptor must be surrounded by quotes: FALSE
# Allows multiple descriptors: FALSE
#
# EXAMPLE: -t D:\PathToTextCorpus\TextCorpusDirectory


# Path to directory for where the .xml files generated by annotator one are stored.  The annotations can be created by either a manual
# annotator or RapTAT. All annotations must be in either eHOST or Knowtator format for both sets of XML.

# Property descriptor requires proper upper and lower case: TRUE
# Property descriptor must be surrounded by quotes: FALSE
# Allows multiple descriptors: FALSE
#
# EXAMPLE: -r D:\PathToAnnotatorOneAnnotations\AnnotatorOneXMLFiles


# Path to directory for where the .xml files generated by annotator two are stored.  The annotations can be created by either a manual
# annotator, RapTAT, or another program.  All annotations must be in either eHOST or Knowtator format for both sets of XML.
