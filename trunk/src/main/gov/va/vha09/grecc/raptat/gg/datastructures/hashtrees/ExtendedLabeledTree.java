   * *********************************************************** Adds the token string or string
   * stems of the current phrase to this tree. Helper method for addLabeledPhrase(List<Token>).
   * Unlike the superclass LabeledHashTree method, this method labels everything up to the last
   * token in a sequence equally, every time it is called, whereas, for the superclass, it is only
   * labeled equally when the sequence is first put into the structure.
   *
   * <p>
   * Precondition: Tokens in the input phrase are in the exact order that they exist within the
   * string that constitutes the inputPhrase. Also, input sequence is not null, and length â‰¥ 1.
   *
   * <p>
   * Post-condition: Strings are added to the tree and the setting of the labeled field is updated
   * to reflect this.
   *
   * @param inputSequence
   * @param curDepth
   * @return The depth at which the sequence was found to be new. For example, if "the dog is
   *         running" is the phrase, and "the dog" is already in the tree, the number returned would
   *         be 2, and both "the dog is" and "the dog is running would be new. If the entire
   *         sequence was new, the number returned would be 0, and "the", "the dog", etc. would all
   *         be new sequences.
