CRF MODEL OPTIMIZATION

1.	Run main() within the CSAttributeTaggerTrainer class with the runType variable set to 
	RUN_TYPE.PRINT_FEATURES.  The parameters 'cueIncludedFeaturesFilePath' and 
	'scopeIncludedFeaturesFilePath,' should be set to null so that all features generated 
	by the feature builder are included in the model.
	
2.	Next, run main() with the CrfSuiteRunner class with the runType variable set to 
	SuiteRunnerType.ESTIMATE_PARAMETERS.  The trainingFileName should be the file created
	in step 1 above.  The 'samples' parameter should be set to 10 (other numbers can be used),
	and tokenProcessingOptions the same as when the feature file was created in step 1.
	
3.	Open up the parameter file created in step 2, and identify features according to whether 
	a) they were estimated at least 3 times in step 2 (should be 3 or more parameter estimate
	numbers) b) the average +/- the standard error of the mean crosses 0.  Note that each
	feature will be associated with each label, and these features are unique.  However, we cannot
	pick specific features for inclusion or exclusion - we can only include or exclude features
	without respect to label.  So, we include features where the feature + label for anyone label
	does not cross 0.  Features where all associated labels cross zero are excluded.
	
4.	Create a text file containing all of the features to be included in the model based on the analysis
	done in step 3.
	
5.	Re-run step 1 but set the 'cueIncludedFeaturesFilePath' and 'scopeIncludedFeaturesFilePath,' to the
	file(s) created in step 4.  (If optimizing cue and scope models, there will be 2 files).
	
6.	Re-run steps 2-4 creating yet another text file with just the included features.  At this point, we 
	will have gone through 2 rounds of feature inclusion/exclusion.  The included feature lists are then
	used for final training via the CSAttributeTaggerTrainer class, which is run with runType set to 
	TRAIN_NEGATION_SINGLE and the parameters cueIncludedFeaturesFilePath & scopeIncludedFeaturesFilePath
	set to the last feature inclusion files (see step 4).
