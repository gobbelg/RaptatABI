Here, we want to first find the cues using the existing cue model.  Then for any cues found, we
want to add the cue feature to the appropriate tokens.  Then, for sentences having cues, we want to find
the scope.  Finally, we want to add attributes to annotations that are "in scope".  Steps in this process are:

1.	Identify the sentences that contain concepts of interest.  These will be used to see if cues exist.  To do 
	this, we first select all sentences that have concepts of interest as shown by an import of xml documents.
		
2.	Next we run the sentences through a Mallet-based feature builder to determine the features of
	all tokens in each sentence, using the AssertionFeaturePipe to insert the most important 
	features.
	
3.	We then run the features through the
